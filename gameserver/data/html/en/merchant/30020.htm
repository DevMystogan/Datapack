Blacksmith Baggins:<br>
Dwarves can collect and process various materials and items.<br>
Throughout the years of practice, I mastered the item enchantment technique.<br>
If you bring rare items to me, I will make them better.<br><br><br>
You can be confident about my abilities.<br>
Ordinary blacksmiths cannot do anything like thatâ€¦ <br><br>
