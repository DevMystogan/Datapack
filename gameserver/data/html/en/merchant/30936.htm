Collector Pona:<br>
I have been traveling around the world in constant search for jewelry for a hundred years now. I am... exhausted... I will rest here. I like this place. Hoho!<br><br>
Hm! Who are you? Do you have something for me?<br>
I am only interested in rarities but you have come a long way to find me. I will show you my merchandise. Hmm... What will suit you most?<br><br>
