Ha! Do you want to add special abilities to your weapon? Great idea. Enchant? Don't worry! Special effects have nothing to do with the Enchant. <font color="LEVEL">Our blacksmiths will help you insert a Rune into your weapon</font> if it has a necessary slot. <br>
You just need to choose which Rune to put into what weapon!! <br><br>
By the way! If you have a lot of Runes you don't need, I can exchange them for other ones. Of course, no telling what Runes you'll end up with... <br>
But take a shot, it's worth it. Life is but a game... <br>
